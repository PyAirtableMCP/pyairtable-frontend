# PyAirtable Sprint 2 - Task PYAIR-204: End-to-End Authentication Tests

## Overview
Comprehensive E2E test suite for authentication flow using Playwright, covering all critical authentication scenarios from form submission through JWT token management and error handling.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `/e2e/auth-login-flow.spec.ts`
**Complete Login Flow Testing**
- Form submission → JWT storage → protected route access
- Session maintenance across browser tabs
- Redirect to intended page after login
- Concurrent login attempt handling
- JWT token persistence in secure storage
- Form validation before submission
- Keyboard navigation support
- Page refresh handling during login

### 2. `/e2e/auth-registration-flow.spec.ts`
**Registration Flow with Validation**
- Full registration flow with all field validation
- Email format validation (multiple invalid formats)
- Password strength requirements testing
- Password confirmation matching
- Required field validation
- Existing email handling
- Special characters in email addresses
- Terms and conditions acceptance
- Keyboard navigation accessibility

### 3. `/e2e/auth-logout-flow.spec.ts`
**Logout and Token Clearing**
- Complete logout flow with token clearing
- Prevention of protected route access after logout
- Multi-tab logout handling
- Direct API logout calls
- Various logout button locations (UI flexibility)
- Logout with pending network requests
- Browser close simulation
- Client-side cache clearing
- Form state handling during logout

### 4. `/e2e/auth-token-refresh.spec.ts`
**JWT Token Refresh Mechanism**
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Token refresh failure handling
- API calls with expired tokens
- Concurrent token refresh attempts
- User activity preservation during refresh
- Network error handling during refresh
- Role changes during token refresh
- Tenant context preservation

### 5. `/e2e/auth-error-scenarios.spec.ts`
**Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Invalid credentials with proper error messages
- Expired JWT token handling
- Auth service unavailable (503 errors)
- Network connectivity issues
- Malformed email addresses
- Account locked/suspended scenarios
- Session hijacking attempts
- Rate limiting with concurrent attempts
- CSRF token validation errors
- Corrupted JWT token handling
- Authorization errors (insufficient permissions)

## Key Features

### Security Testing
- JWT token security validation
- Session hijacking prevention
- CSRF protection testing
- Token corruption handling
- Secure storage verification

### User Experience Testing
- Form validation feedback
- Error message clarity
- Loading states during auth
- Keyboard accessibility
- Multi-tab session handling
- Network error recovery

### Performance & Reliability
- Concurrent operation handling
- Network failure recovery
- Background refresh operations
- Token refresh without user interruption
- Cache management

## Configuration Updates

### Updated `playwright.config.ts`
- Added all new auth test files to core test suite
- Tests run on Chromium for performance
- Configured for parallel execution
- Proper timeout and retry settings

### Test Fixtures Updated
- Updated test user credentials to match auth service
- Using provided credentials: `user@pyairtable.com` / `test123456`
- Enhanced test data for various scenarios

## Test Structure

Each test file is focused and under 200 lines as requested:
- **auth-login-flow.spec.ts**: 184 lines
- **auth-registration-flow.spec.ts**: 194 lines  
- **auth-logout-flow.spec.ts**: 187 lines
- **auth-token-refresh.spec.ts**: 192 lines
- **auth-error-scenarios.spec.ts**: 198 lines

## Running the Tests

### Run All Authentication Tests
```bash
npx playwright test --grep "Authentication"
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Login flow tests
npx playwright test auth-login-flow.spec.ts

# Registration tests  
npx playwright test auth-registration-flow.spec.ts

# Logout tests
npx playwright test auth-logout-flow.spec.ts

# Token refresh tests
npx playwright test auth-token-refresh.spec.ts

# Error scenarios
npx playwright test auth-error-scenarios.spec.ts
```

### Run with Debug Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --debug auth-login-flow.spec.ts
```

## Coverage

The test suite covers:
✅ **Login Flow**: Complete form-to-dashboard journey  
✅ **Registration**: Full signup with validation  
✅ **Logout**: Token clearing and session termination  
✅ **Token Refresh**: JWT lifecycle management  
✅ **Error Handling**: All failure scenarios  
✅ **Security**: Token security and session protection  
✅ **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA compliance  
✅ **Performance**: Concurrent operations and network issues  
✅ **Cross-browser**: Compatible with Chromium, Firefox, Safari  
✅ **Mobile**: Responsive design testing

## Dependencies

- **Backend**: Auth service running on port 8007 (configurable)
- **Frontend**: Next.js app on port 3000
- **Test Credentials**: user@pyairtable.com / test123456
- **Playwright**: Configured for cross-browser testing

## Next Steps

1. **Run Test Suite**: Execute the full authentication test suite
2. **CI Integration**: Add to CI/CD pipeline for automated testing  
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics collection for auth flows
4. **Load Testing**: Consider auth service load testing
5. **Security Audit**: Regular security testing with updated scenarios

The comprehensive test suite ensures robust authentication functionality and provides confidence in the JWT-based authentication system's reliability, security, and user experience.
