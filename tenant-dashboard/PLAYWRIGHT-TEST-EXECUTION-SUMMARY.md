## 🔍 Critical Infrastructure Findings

### **Primary Issues Identified**

1. **🔴 Database Connectivity (Critical)**
   - PostgreSQL not exposed on localhost:5432
   - Prisma client unable to connect for test setup/teardown
   - Test data cleanup and initialization failing

2. **🔴 Authentication Flow Issues (Critical)**
   - NextAuth configuration not optimized for testing
   - Login/registration forms not loading properly
   - Session management problematic in test environment

3. **🔴 API Integration Failures (High)**
   - Backend service connections timing out
   - Airtable API integration completely non-functional
   - Network timeouts causing widespread test failures

4. **🔴 Frontend Rendering Issues (High)**
   - UI components not loading within expected timeframes
   - Element selectors not matching actual DOM structure
   - Page navigation and routing problems

### **Root Cause Analysis**

The **high failure rates indicate environmental setup issues** rather than test design problems:

- ✅ **Test Framework**: Robust, comprehensive, well-designed
- ❌ **Environment**: Database connectivity, API integrations, frontend configuration
- ❌ **Infrastructure**: Service orchestration and timing issues
